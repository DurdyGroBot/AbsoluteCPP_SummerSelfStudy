/*The gravitational attractive force between two bodies with masses m1 and m2 separated by a distance d is given by
 * the following formula: F = Gm1m2/d2 G = 6.673E-8 cm^3/(g*s^2) where G is the universal gravitational
 * constant: -83 2 Write a function definition that takes arguments for the masses of two bodies and the distance
 * between them and returns the gravitational force between them. Since you will use the previous formula, the
 * gravitational force will be in dynes. One dyne equals a g â€¢ cm/sec2
 * You should use a globally defined constant for the universal gravitational constant. Embed your function definition
 * in a complete program that computes the gravita- tional force between two objects given suitable inputs. Your
 * program should allow the user to repeat this calculation as often as the user wishes.*/
